Features
^^^^^^^^

* Written in C (C11), compatible with ``size_t`` and ``uintmax_t`` types for some specifiers
* Implements output functions compatible with ``printf``, ``vprintf``, ``snprintf``, ``sprintf`` and ``vsnprintf``
* Low-memory footprint, suitable for embedded systems
* Reentrant access to all API functions
* Operating-system ready
* Requires single output function to be implemented by user for ``printf``-like API calls
* With optional functions for operating systems to protect multiple threads printing to the same output stream
* Allows multiple output stream functions (unlike standard ``printf`` which supports only one) to separate parts of application
* Added additional specifiers vs original features
* User friendly MIT license

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* C compiler
* Few kB of non-volatile memory
